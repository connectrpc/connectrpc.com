## Why

<!-- A few paragraphs explaining your proposal in more detail. Why is this a
good idea? -->

## Anticipated complications

<!-- If we adopt this proposal, are there any foreseeable adverse effects? How
can we mitigate them? -->

## Alternatives

<!-- Instead of this idea, what else could we do? Write a short paragraph about
the most compelling alternatives and explain why they're not as good as your
proposal. Don't forget that doing nothing and waiting is always an alternative
too! -->
