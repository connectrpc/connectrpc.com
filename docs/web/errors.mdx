Similar to the familiar "404 Not Found" and "500 Internal Server Error" status
codes you may have seen in HTTP, Connect uses a set of [16 error codes](/docs/protocol#error-codes).
In the Connect protocol, an error is always represented as JSON, and is easily
readable in the developer tools of your browser. For example:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "invalid_argument",
  "message": "sentence cannot be empty"
}
```

With the gRPC-web protocol, errors are usually not human-readable, but
Connect provides a common type that represents errors consistently across
all supported protocols.


## Working with errors

All errors are represented by [`ConnectError`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/1c1dc4cfd300e120d07a486f488d5693139f9dee/packages/connect/src/connect-error.ts#L27),
a subtype of the built-in `Error` class. Using a try-catch block, we can catch
any error that occurred during a call:

```ts
import { ConnectError } from "@bufbuild/connect";

try {
  await client.say({sentence: ""});
} catch (err) {
  // We have to verify err is a ConnectError
  // before using it as one.
  if (err instanceof ConnectError) {
    err.code;    // Code.InvalidArgument
    err.message; // "[invalid_argument] sentence cannot be empty"
  }
  // Alternatively, we can use ConnectError.from()
  // It returns a ConnectError as is, and converts any
  // other error to a ConnectError.
  const connectErr = ConnectError.from(err);
  connectErr.code;    // Code.InvalidArgument
  connectErr.message; // "[invalid_argument] sentence cannot be empty"
}
```


## Error codes

The `code` property holds one of Connects [error codes](/docs/protocol#error-codes).
All error codes are available through the TypeScript enumeration [`Code`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/1c1dc4cfd300e120d07a486f488d5693139f9dee/packages/connect/src/code.ts#L16).
Note that a code is an integer value, but can easily be converted to and
from a string value.

```ts
import { Code } from "@bufbuild/connect";

let code = Code.InvalidArgument;
code; // 3
let name = Code[code]; // "InvalidArgument"
let val: Code = Code["InvalidArgument"]; // 3
```


## Error messages

The `message` property contains a descriptive error message. In most cases,
the message is provided by the backend implementing the service. Because
`message` is the only property that shows up in the browser console for
uncaught errors, the error message is always prefixed with the error code.
In case you _do_ want the original error message without a code prefix, use
the property `rawMessage`.

```ts
err.message; // "[invalid_argument] sentence cannot be empty"
if (err.code == Code.InvalidArgument) {
  err.rawMessage; // "sentence cannot be empty"
}
```


## Metadata

If you catch an error, your program takes an exception from the regular code
path, but you might still want to access a header or trailer value. Connect
provides a union of header and trailer values in the `metadata` property as a
simple `Headers` object:

```ts
err.metadata.get("Custom-Header-Value");
err.metadata.get("Custom-Trailer-Value");
```


## Error details

On the wire, error details are wrapped with `google.protobuf.Any`, so that a
server or middleware can attach arbitrary data to an error. Using the method
`findDetails()`, you can decode the details from an error.

The method takes a protobuf message type as an argument, and returns an array
of decoded messages of this type.

This example looks up a localized error message in the users preferred
language:

```ts
import { ConnectError } from "@bufbuild/connect";
import { LocalizedMessage } from "./error_details_pb.js";

function handle(err: ConnectError) {
  const localized = err.findDetails(LocalizedMessage)
    .find(i => i.locale === navigator.language);
  console.log(localized?.message);
}
```

We are using the protobuf message [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`](https://buf.build/googleapis/googleapis/file/main:google/rpc/error_details.proto#L241)
in this example, but any protobuf message can be transmitted as error details.

Alternatively, `findDetails()` takes a registry as an argument. See the
[protobuf-es documentation](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/docs/runtime_api.md#registries)
for details.


## Cancellation

There may be cases where you want to cancel a call, for example because the
user closed a dialog. All client methods take an optional [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
as an argument for this purpose. If this signal is aborted, the browser stops
the request, and the fetch API raises an `AbortError` to abort the code path
of the application.

Connect converts those errors into a `ConnectError` with code `Canceled`,
so that you can handle cancellation appropriately:

```ts
import { createPromiseClient, ConnectError, Code } from "@bufbuild/connect";

const client = createPromiseClient(ElizaService, ...);

// For the sake of this example, let's cancel the request right away
const abort = new AbortController();
abort.abort();

try {
  await client.say({sentence: "I feel..."}, { signal: abort.signal });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ConnectError && err.code != Code.Canceled) {
    // handle the genuine error, ignoring cancelled requests
  }
}
```

There is no silver bullet to error handling with async/await and cancellation.
In general, we recommend to let exception travel up to a central error handler
in your application, and only catch errors in the case they need to be
explicitly handled in your business logic.

But your use case may vary, and we encourage you to [roll your own client](/docs/web/using-clients#roll-your-own-client)
if you want to represent errors and cancellation differently.
