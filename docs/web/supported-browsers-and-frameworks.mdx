Connect supports all modern web browsers that implement the widely
available [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
and the [Encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API).
The library and the generated code are compatible with ES2017 and TypeScript 4.1.

Connect is entirely framework-agnostic and will even work with vanilla Javascript.
It is compatible with commonly-used package managers such as [npm](https://npmjs.com),
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). It works out of the
box with most popular application and testing frameworks including [React](https://reactjs.org),
[Remix](https://remix.run), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org),
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). It also
integrates seamlessly with various module loaders and bundlers such as [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io),
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).

You can find examples for many popular frameworks in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.
