Connect supports all modern web browsers that implement the widely
available [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
and the [Encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API).
The library and the generated code are compatible with ES2017 and TypeScript 4.1.

Connect is entirely framework-agnostic and will even work with vanilla Javascript.
It is compatible with commonly-used package managers such as [npm](https://npmjs.com),
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). It works out of the
box with most popular application and testing frameworks including [React](https://reactjs.org),
[Remix](https://remix.run), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org),
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). It also
integrates seamlessly with various module loaders and bundlers such as [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io),
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).

You can find examples for many popular frameworks in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

## React Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) does not offer great support for the Fetch API and the Text Encoding API.  As
such, React Native requires a polyfill for these two implementations.  We recommend the following to accomplish this:

1. Install the polyfills.

```bash
npm install react-native-fast-encoder react-native-fetch-api web-streams-polyfill
```

2. Apply the polyfills in the root of your app.

```js
import { polyfillGlobal } from "react-native/Libraries/Utilities/PolyfillFunctions"
import TextEncoder from "react-native-fast-encoder"
import { fetch, Headers, Request, Response } from "react-native-fetch-api"
import { ReadableStream } from "web-streams-polyfill"

polyfillGlobal("ReadableStream", () => ReadableStream)
polyfillGlobal("TextDecoder", () => TextEncoder)
polyfillGlobal("TextEncoder", () => TextEncoder)
polyfillGlobal(
  "fetch", () => (...args) => fetch(args[0], {
    ...args[1],
    // Inject textStreaming: https://github.com/react-native-community/fetch/issues/15
    reactNative: { textStreaming: true }
  }),
)
polyfillGlobal("Headers", () => Headers)
polyfillGlobal("Request", () => Request)
polyfillGlobal("Response", () => Response)
```

Unfortunately, only unary requests via the [Connect protocol](../protocol.md) are supported in
React Native due to some limitations in React Native's implementation of the Fetch API. For more information, please see
[this issue](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/issues/199)

For a working example, see the [React Native project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react-native)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.
