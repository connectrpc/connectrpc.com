Connect supports all modern web browsers that implement the widely
available [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
and the [Encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API).
The library and the generated code are compatible with ES2017 and TypeScript 4.1.

Connect is entirely framework-agnostic and will even work with vanilla Javascript.
It is compatible with commonly-used package managers such as [npm](https://npmjs.com),
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). It works out of the
box with most popular application and testing frameworks including [React](https://reactjs.org),
[Remix](https://remix.run), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org),
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). It also
integrates seamlessly with various module loaders and bundlers such as [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io),
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).

However, there are some gotchas to be aware of as well as common errors that you may encounter when attempting to set up
your stack. The issues vary depending on the tooling in your project. This page explains some helpful workarounds
with links to examples.

## Webpack

If your project is using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and you are generating pure TypeScript artifacts via your `buf.gen.yaml` file, you may
see an error similar to the following:

```
Failed to compile.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '<import name>' in 'path/to/your/connect/genfiles'
```

This is because if you are using `opt: target=ts` as part of your plugin configuration, `protoc-gen-es` will generate only TypeScript
files. However, these files will use imports internally that specify a `.js` extension. This is in accordance with the
ECMAScript specification, but may cause some difficulty loading these files.

Fortunately, some workarounds exist depending on your version of Webpack.

### v5.74.0 and above

If you are using Webpack [v5.74.0](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.74.0) and above, there is an option
called [extensionAlias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensionalias) that you can add to the
`resolve` section of your Webpack config file. This will tell Webpack how to alias TypeScript file extensions and load
them properly.

For a working example, see the [Webpack project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react/webpack)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

### v5.73.0 and below

If you are using a version < v5.74.0 and are not able to upgrade, then you have three options:

**Use the `import_extension` option**

The code generator plugins used by Connect and its dependency [Protobuf-ES](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es) will
add a `.js` extension to import paths by default. However, you can configure these plugins to use a different value
using the plugin option `import_extension`. Visit the docs [here](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/tree/main/packages/protoc-gen-es#import_extensionjs) for details.

Note that if you do use this approach, you will need to set this option on both
the Protobuf-ES plugin and the Connect-ES plugin.

For example, in your `buf.gen.yaml`:

```diff
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: es
    out: gen
+   opt: import_extension=none
  - plugin: connect-es
    out: gen
+   opt: import_extension=none
```

**Output JavaScript files**

Changing the target setting in your `buf.gen.yaml` to `opt: target=js+dts` will eliminate the file resolving issue as it
will generate JavaScript files with a `.js` extension.

Note that the default generation option is `target=js+dts` so omitting this `opt` option from your config will also do the trick. For example:

```diff
- opt: target=ts
+ opt: target=js+dts
```

or remove altogether.

```diff
- opt: target=ts
```

**Use the Resolve TypeScript Plugin**

If you would still prefer to use `opt: target=ts`, it is recommended to use the
[Resolve TypeScript Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin). For more details on why this is
necessary, see the README of this plugin.

Note that some scaffolding tools such as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) both use Webpack as their underlying bundler and at press time are using
a version of Webpack < 5.74.0. In addition, they discourage modification of the underlying Webpack config. Therefore,
until these tools are updated to the latest version of Webpack, the recommended workaround is to use `opt: target=js+dts`
as this is the path of least resistance.

If you've come this far and you _still_ want to output TypeScript files, there are libraries you can use to override
the Webpack config in the above tools such as [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and
[Angular Builders Custom Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack)

For a working example of the above with Create React App, see the
[Create React App project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react/cra) in the
[examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

## Cypress

[Cypress](https://cypress.io/) is an end-to-end testing framework that uses Webpack as its module bundler and as a result will
also experience the file resolving issue. The options specified under [v5.73.0 and below](#v5730-and-below) also apply.
However, modifying the Webpack config in Cypress is a bit easier, so if you'd prefer to output TypeScript files, you'll
also need a Cypress plugin called [Cypress Webpack Preprocessor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/webpack-preprocessor), which
should be packaged with Cypress by default.

The Webpack overrides will need to be in your `cypress.config` file. An example config would look something like this:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
// highlight-start
const webpackPreprocessor = require("@cypress/webpack-preprocessor");
const ResolveTypeScriptPlugin = require("resolve-typescript-plugin");
// highlight-end

const options = {
  webpackOptions: {
    resolve: {
      extensions: [".ts", ".tsx", ".js"],
      // highlight-start
      plugins: [new ResolveTypeScriptPlugin()],
      // highlight-end
    },
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.tsx?$/,
          loader: "ts-loader",
          options: { transpileOnly: true },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    specPattern: "cypress/e2e/**/*.{cy,spec}.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:4173",
    // highlight-start
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on("file:preprocessor", webpackPreprocessor(options));
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
});
```

For a working example, see the [Vue project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/vue)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

## Parcel

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org) is another build tool that is susceptible to the aforementioned resolver issue. With
Parcel, you will see an error similar to:

```bash
@parcel/resolver-default: Cannot load file 'path/to/your/connect/genfiles'
```

As a result, the current recommendation when using Parcel is to eschew the usage of `target=ts` in your `buf.gen.yaml`
file and instead to use `opt: target=js+dts`.

Unfortunately, if you still prefer to use `target=ts`, there is no workaround at this time as no plugin exists similar to the Webpack
[Resolve TypeScript Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin). For more details, see this
[Github issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/7823).

## React Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) does not offer great support for the Fetch API and the Text Encoding API. As
such, React Native requires a polyfill for these two implementations. We recommend
[react-native-polyfill-globals](https://github.com/acostalima/react-native-polyfill-globals) to accomplish this:

- Install the aforementioned [react-native-polyfill-globals](https://github.com/acostalima/react-native-polyfill-globals) project.
- Next, follow the `Polyfill all automatically` instructions under **Usage**.
- Finally, apply the patches included in the project. It is recommended to use the `patch-package` instructions.

Unfortunately, only unary requests via the [Connect protocol](../protocol.md) are supported in
React Native due to some limitations in the above polyfills.

If you would like to see improved support, please give us a +1 on [this issue](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/issues/199)
and we will prioritize it accordingly.

For a working example, see the [React Native project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react-native)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

## Jest

There is one configuration to be aware of when using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in concert with the `opt: target=ts` option in `buf.gen.yaml`.

For Jest to find generated artifacts, you will need to specify a `moduleNameMapper` option in your `package.json` file
as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "buf-cra",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  },
  // highlight-start
  "jest": {
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "(.+)\\.js": "$1"
    }
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

For a working example, see the [Create React App project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react/cra)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.
