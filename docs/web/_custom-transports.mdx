A Transport is responsible for communication with a service over the wire.
Usually, it constructs a URL using the service and method name, serializes
the request message, and runs an HTTP request. It then deserializes the
response and returns it to the caller. Transports typically provide
configuration options for the server address, serialization, and related
concerns.

## Using a Transport directly

Transports are objects with a method for every RPC type. Because web browsers
only support unary and server streaming RPCs, Connect's [Transport interface](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/614cf0b8278df83e4af22cd70201fd848d9d3ba4/packages/connect-web/src/transport.ts#L24)
only defines the two methods `unary()` and `serverStream()`. Typically, you
would not want to call these methods directly. A [Client](/docs/web/using-clients)
binds a service definition to a Transport, and provides more convenient and
idiomatic access to the methods defined by the service.

There may be rare cases where direct access to this layer is desirable, and
when implementing your own Transports or Clients, it is important to
understand how to interface with them.

The following example shows how to call the RPC `Say` directly on the
Transport, without a Client in between:

```ts
const abortSignal = undefined; // We do not use cancellation in this example
const timeoutMs = undefined; // We do not use timeouts in this example
const response = await transport.unary(
  ElizaService,
  ElizaService.methods.say,
  abortSignal,
  timeoutMs,
  new Headers(),
  new SayRequest({ sentence: "I feel happy." }),
);
console.log(response.message.sentence);
```

## Implementing a Transport

Connect comes with Transports for two protocols, but depending on your
use case, you may want to implement your own Transport. For example, you
could implement a stub-transport for your test suite, to let all clients
respond with pre-defined messages without hitting the network.

In the following example, we are going to implement a very simple variant
of such a Transport - it simply returns the default response message with
default field values.

But we have to make a short excursion to Interceptors first, to understand
some underlying primitives. Any Transport that accepts Interceptors needs to
provide a function to execute an RPC, which the Interceptors can then wrap
to observe or change behavior. There are two distinct function types:

- [`UnaryFn`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L58) -
  a function that executes a unary RPC
- [`StreamingFn`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L70) -
  a function that executes a server-streaming RPC

There are also four distinct request and response types used as arguments
or return types respectively by the two function types:

- [`UnaryRequest`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L82) -
  a request with a single message
- [`UnaryResponse`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L102) -
  a response with a single messages
- [`StreamRequst`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L122) -
  a request with zero or more messages
- [`StreamResponse`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/755dda7fdb9b9a70e70dd64e08771fa87c253fa9/packages/connect-core/src/interceptor.ts#L146) -
  a response with zero or more messages

For a start, let us create three helper functions to create request and
response stubs:

```ts
// stub-transport.ts
import type { UnaryRequest, UnaryResponse, StreamResponse } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import type { AnyMessage, Message, MethodInfo, ServiceType, PartialMessage } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";

/**
 * Create a request with a single message.
 */
function createUnaryRequest<T extends Message<T>>(
  service: ServiceType,
  method: MethodInfo<T, AnyMessage>,
  signal: AbortSignal | undefined,
  header: HeadersInit | undefined,
  message: PartialMessage<T>
): UnaryRequest<T> {
  signal = signal ?? new AbortController().signal;
  return {
    stream: false,
    service,
    method,
    url: "fake",
    init: {},
    signal,
    header: new Headers(header),
    message: new method.I(message),
  };
}

/**
 * Create a response with a single message with default values.
 */
function createUnaryResponse<T extends Message<T>>(
  service: ServiceType,
  method: MethodInfo<AnyMessage, T>
): UnaryResponse<T> {
  return {
    stream: false,
    service,
    method,
    header: new Headers(),
    message: new method.O(),
    trailer: new Headers(),
  };
}

/**
 * Create a streaming response with three messages with default values.
 */
function createStreamResponse<T extends Message<T>>(
  service: ServiceType,
  method: MethodInfo<AnyMessage, T>
): StreamResponse<T> {
  const responses = [new method.O(), new method.O(), new method.O()];
  return {
    stream: true,
    service,
    method,
    header: new Headers(),
    read() {
      const value = responses.pop();
      return Promise.resolve(value ? { done: false, value } : { done: true });
    },
    trailer: new Headers(),
  };
}
```

Now that we can easily stub responses, the Transport implementation is very
simple:

```ts
// stub-transport.ts
import type { Interceptor, runUnary, runServerStream } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";

/**
 * Create a stub transport that only returns default response messages.
 */
function createStubTransport(interceptors?: Interceptor[]): Transport {
  return {
    unary(service, method, signal, timeoutMs, header, message) {
      return runUnary(
        createUnaryRequest(service, method, signal, header, message),
        // This is the UnaryFn that will be wrapped by interceptors:
        (_req) => Promise.resolve(createUnaryResponse(service, method)),
        interceptors
      );
    },
    serverStream(service, method, signal, timeoutMs, header, message) {
      signal = signal ?? new AbortController().signal;
      return runServerStream(
        createUnaryRequest(service, method, signal, header, message),
        // This is the ServerStreamFn that will be wrapped by interceptors:
        (_req) => Promise.resolve(createStreamResponse(service, method)),
        interceptors
      );
    },
  };
}
```

Using the new Transport:

```ts
import { createPromiseClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { createStubTransport } from "./stub-transport.js";
import { ElizaService } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.bufbuild_connect-es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_connect";

const transport = createStubTransport();
const client = createPromiseClient(ElizaService, transport);
const res = await client.say({sentence: "I feel happy."});
console.log(res.sentence); // Will print an empty string
```

As you can see, the new Transport is interchangeable with other transports.

As it is, it has limited use in tests, because it does not give you control
over the stubs it responds with. You could extend its capabilities, but we
hope we were able to give you some insight into the inner workings of a
Transport. To recap, we learned:
- Transports are simple objects with just two methods.
- They create a request object, and an executing `UnaryFn` or `ServerStreamFn`.
- They call `runUnary()` or `runServerStreaming()` to let interceptors wrap the executing function.
- They are independent of [Clients](/docs/web/using-clients).
