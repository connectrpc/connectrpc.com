title: Using clients

We have already been using the function `createClient` in the tutorial. The
function gives us a client that uses ECMAScript promise objects. In combination
with the `await` keyword, this lets you write asynchronous
code in a natural and easily readable way:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { ElizaService } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.bufbuild_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";

const client = createClient(ElizaService, transport);

const res = await client.say({
  sentence: "I feel happy.",
});
console.log(res.sentence);
```

For server-streaming RPCs, the corresponding method on the client will return
an async iterable stream of response messages that can be used with the
`for await...of` statement:

```ts
for await (const res of client.introduce({ name: "Joseph" })) {
  console.log(res);
}
```

## Callbacks

If you prefer a callback-based approach, the client returned by the function
`createCallbackClient` should suit you:

```ts
import { createCallbackClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { ElizaService } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.bufbuild_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";

const client = createCallbackClient(ElizaService, transport);

client.say({ sentence: "I feel happy." }, (err, res) => {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(res.sentence);
  }
});
```

For server-streaming RPCs, the corresponding method on the client takes two
callback functions: one that is called every time a response message arrives,
and one that is called at the end of the stream.

```ts
import {ConnectError} from "@connectrpc/connect";

client.introduce({name: "Joseph"}, (res) => {
  console.log(res);
}, (err?: ConnectError) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
});
```

The callback client is particularly useful if you want to migrate an existing
code base from gRPC-web to Connect clients.


## Managing clients and transports

In practice, you will likely want to avoid creating a new transport every time
you want to use a client. It really depends on the framework of your choice,
but there usually is a simple solution to avoid repetition.

For example, you can easily create a custom hook in React:

```ts
// use-client.ts
import { useMemo } from "react";
import { ServiceType } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";
import { createConnectTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";
import { createClient, PromiseClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";

// This transport is going to be used throughout the app
const transport = createConnectTransport({
  baseUrl: "https://demo.connectrpc.com",
});

/**
* Get a promise client for the given service.
*/
export function useClient<T extends ServiceType>(service: T): PromiseClient<T> {
  // We memoize the client, so that we only create one instance per service.
  return useMemo(() => createClient(service, transport), [service]);
}
```

Usage:

```ts
await useClient(ElizaService).say({sentence: "I feel happy."});
```

## Roll your own client

If you find that neither client suits your needs perfectly, it might be an
option for you to roll your own. For example, you might prefer [Rust-style
result types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/result.html)
over promise rejections, and could write your own constructor function that
uses the [neverthrow library](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow) for
method return values.

For a working example, see the [custom-client](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/custom-client)
in the [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo, or take
a look at the implementation of `createClient` and `createCallbackClient`.
