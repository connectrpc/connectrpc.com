title: Cancellation & Timeouts

There may be cases where you want to cancel a call, because you are no longer
interested in the response. For example, you want to show search results as soon
as the user starts typing, but when the user enters another term, you want to
cancel the previous call. Let's take a look at cancellation, and the complementary
topic of timeouts.


## Cancellation

To cancel a call, you can pass an [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) to every client method.
If the signal triggers, the network call is cancelled, and the response promise
for your call is rejected:

```ts
import { createClient, ConnectError, Code } from "@connectrpc/connect";

const client = createClient(ElizaService, ...);

// For the sake of this example, let's cancel the request right away
const abort = new AbortController();
abort.abort();

try {
  await client.say({sentence: "I feel..."}, { signal: abort.signal });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ConnectError && err.code != Code.Canceled) {
    // handle the genuine error, ignoring cancelled requests
  }
}
```

Note that our client raises a `ConnectError` with code `Canceled`, instead of a
`DOMException` that fetch() would raise.


## Timeouts

Similar to the `signal` option for cancellation, there is also the `timeoutMs`
option, which allows you to specify a timeout, in milliseconds, for an individual
call. Here is an example:

```ts
try {
  const req = { name: "Joe" };
  // If this call takes more than 200 milliseconds, it is canceled
  for await (const res of client.introduce(req, { timeoutMs: 200 })) {
    console.log(res.sentence);
  }
} catch (err) {
  // Note that our client raises a ConnectError with Code.DeadlineExceeded
  if (err instanceof ConnectError && err.code === Code.DeadlineExceeded) {
    // handle the timeout error
  }
}
```

When a timeout is reached before the request finishes, a `ConnectError` with
code `DeadlineExceeded` is raised.

When you specify a timeout, the value is sent to the server in a request header
that is understood by Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-web servers. Servers _and_ clients
honor the timeout, which can be immensely helpful for streaming calls in a fragile
network environment. Timeouts can also be propagated to upstream services.
In gRPC, the concept is also known as [deadlines](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/deadlines/).
