title: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Many frameworks offer server-side rendering (SSR) support, which is the ability to render a page on the server-side and
then send this information to the client as HTML. SSR provides many benefits such as:

* Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO) support.
* Resilience in the face of issues such as network connectivity, ad blockers, and obstacles to loading JavaScript.
* The ability to incrementally render data without forcing the user to wait for the entire page to load.

The last benefit is where Connect-ES fits in. Consider a scenario where your application needs to make many API requests
for data that rarely changes. Using Connect-ES with SSR allows you to perform these fetches on the server, significantly
reducing the time to [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint),
which is a metric that measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is
rendered on the screen

The main thing to be aware of when dealing with SSR is that any data that crosses a network boundary (i.e. from server
to client) must typically be JSON-serializable by JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, which only supports plain Objects,
Array, Number, String, and Boolean.

**Protobuf message are JSON-serializable out of the box if they:**
- Use the "proto3" syntax (which does not require the [prototype chain to track field presence](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#field-presence-and-default-values)) or the Editions equivalent.
- Do not use `bytes` fields.
- Do not use `int64` or any other 64-bit integer field (unless they have the [option `jstype = JS_STRING`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#scalar-fields)).
- Do not rely on Infinity, or NaN in `double` or `float` fields.

React Server components with Next.js use a more capable serialization logic. In addition to regular JSON-serializable
types, it also supports BigInt, Infinity, NaN, and Uint8Array.

**Protobuf messages are serializable by React out of the box if they:**
- Use the "proto3" syntax (which does not require the [prototype chain to track field presence](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#field-presence-and-default-values)) or the Editions equivalent.

If your Protobuf messages are not serializable, there's a simple solution: You convert them to JSON with the
[toJson function](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#serializing-messages) from
[`@bufbuild/protobuf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf). You can either use the JSON objects (the
[JSON types](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#json-types) feature will be helpful), or
parse them again with `fromJson`.

Let's walk through a few examples in various setups:

## Next.js

### getServerSideProps

The function [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
is invoked at request time and is used to fetch data when a page is requested. The returned data is then passed to your
component in props. `getServiceSideProps` must return JSON.

In the following example, we use the proto3 message `SayResponse`, which is JSON serializable:

```tsx
import type { InferGetServerSidePropsType } from 'next'
import { create } from '@bufbuild/protobuf';
import { SayRequestSchema } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.bufbuild_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";

export const getServerSideProps = (async () => {
  const sayRequest = create(SayRequestSchema, {
    sentence: "hi",
  });
  return { props: { sayRequest } }
});

export default function Page({
  sayRequest,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {
  return (
    <main>
      <p>{sayRequest.sentence}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

The following example uses the message `Payload`, which is not JSON serializable. We convert it to JSON to cross the
boundary:

```tsx
import type { InferGetServerSidePropsType } from 'next'
import { create, toJson, fromJson } from '@bufbuild/protobuf';
import { PayloadSchema } from "./gen/payload_pb";

export const getServerSideProps = (async () => {
  const payload = create(PayloadSchema, {
    largeNumber: 123n,
  });
  return { props: {
    //highlight-next-line
    payloadJson: toJson(payload, PayloadSchema)
  }}
});

export default function Page({
  payloadJson,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {
  //highlight-next-line
  const payload = fromJson(PayloadSchema, payloadJson);
  return (
    <main>
      <p>{payload.largeNumber.toString()}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

The same principle applies to the function [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).

[examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.


### React Server Components

Version 13 of Next.js adds the new App Router, which uses React Server Components. By default, everything is rendered on
the server. In the following example, the Protobuf message we use never crosses the boundary, and there are no limitations
of serialization to consider:

```tsx
import { create } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";
import { PayloadSchema } from "./gen/payload_pb";

export default function Page() {
  const payload = create(PayloadSchema, {
    largeNumber: 123n,
  });
  return (
    <main>
      <p>{payload.largeNumber.toString()}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Let's add a component that runs in the browser:

```tsx
"use client";

import { Payload } from "./gen/payload_pb";

export default function Client({ payload }: { payload: Payload }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h5>Payload rendered on the client</h5>
      <p>{payload.largeNumber.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { create } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";
import { PayloadSchema } from "./gen/payload_pb";
// highlight-next-line
import Client from "./client";

export default function Page() {
  const payload = create(PayloadSchema, {
    largeNumber: 123n,
  });
  return (
    <main>
      // highlight-next-line
      <Client payload={payload}></Client>
    </main>
  );
}
```

When the page is rendered on the server, the props for the component `Client` are serialized, and the component is
rendered in the browser. The `payload` prop crosses the boundary, but since it's a proto3 message, React can serialize
and hydrate it without issues. It handles the BigInt value `123n` correctly.

:::note
If you use Next.js earlier than version 15, be careful with Protobuf `bytes` fields. A Uint8Array turns into a plain
Array when crossing the boundary. This issue is fixed with Next.js 15.

## Svelte

### fetch

Svelte's `load` functions can run on the server, and receive a fetch function that inherits cookies and can make
relative requests. We can pass `fetch` to a transport to make use of this data:

```ts
import type { PageServerLoad } from "./$types";
import { createConnectTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
  const transport = createConnectTransport({
    baseUrl: "/api",
    fetch,
  });
  // call RPCs here
  return {};
};
```

### Server load

Server load functions always run on the server. The data they return is serialized by Svelte, embedded into the document
sent to the web browser, and hydrated on page load. Svelte 5 uses [devalue](https://github.com/rich-harris/devalue) to
serialize data, which fully supports BigInt, Infinity, NaN, and Uint8Array.

As long as you use the "proto3" syntax (which does not require the [prototype chain to track field presence](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#field-presence-and-default-values)) or the Editions equivalent, you can
safely return Protobuf messages from a server load function.


### Universal load

Universal load functions run on the server when the page is first visited. Instead of serializing the data that the
function returns, Svelte serializes the responses from any fetch requests that the function makes. It transparently
hydrates the responses when it runs the load function again in the browser, avoiding additional network requests.

You can safely return any Protobuf message from a universal load function.

By default, [Svelte removes all response headers](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Server-hooks-handle) from serialized
fetch responses. You can configure the behavior with a `hooks.server.ts` file. You must allow at least the `Content-Type`
header for Connect:

```ts
import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) =>
  await resolve(event, {
    filterSerializedResponseHeaders: (name) => name === "content-type",
  });
```

project in our [examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.
