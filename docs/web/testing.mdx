Testing a client application can be a crucial part of ensuring its functionality
and performance. When it comes to web applications, spinning up a full server
to test against may not always be the best option. In the following sections, we
will go through a couple of alternatives.

## Component Testing

For components that interface with Connect, it will generally be desirable to mock your RPCs since a backend may not be
available or desirable to access in a unit test. The easiest way to do this is via Connect's `createRouterTransport`
function.

### Mocking Transports

The function `createRouterTransport` from `@connectrpc/connect` creates an in-memory
server with your own RPC implementations. It allows you to mock a backend to cover different behavior in your component.

To illustrate, let's setup a very simple ELIZA service:

```ts
import { ElizaService } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.connectrpc_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_connect";
import { SayResponse } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.connectrpc_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";
import { createRouterTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect";

const mockTransport = createRouterTransport(({ service }) => {
  service(ElizaService, {
    say: () => new SayResponse({ sentence: "I feel happy." }),
  });
});
```

Under the hood, this mock transport runs nearly the same code that a server running on
Node.js would run. This means that all features from [implementing real services](../node/implementing-services.md)
are available: You can access request headers, raise errors with details, and also
mock streaming responses. Here is an example that raises an error on the fourth
request:

```ts
const mockTransport = createRouterTransport(({ service }) => {
  const sentences: string[] = [];
  service(ElizaService, {
    say(request: SayRequest) {
      sentences.push(request.sentence);
      // highlight-next-line
      if (sentences.length > 3) {
      // highlight-next-line
        throw new ConnectError(
      // highlight-next-line
          "I have no words anymore.",
      // highlight-next-line
          Code.ResourceExhausted,
      // highlight-next-line
        );
      // highlight-next-line
      }
      return new SayResponse({
        sentence: `You said ${sentences.length} sentences.`,
      });
    },
  });
});
```

You can also use expectations to assert that your client sends requests as expected:

```ts
const mockTransport = createRouterTransport(({ service }) => {
  service(ElizaService, {
    say(request) {
      // highlight-next-line
      expect(request.sentence).toBe("how do you feel?");
      return new SayResponse({ sentence: "I feel happy." });
    },
  });
});
```

The `createRouterTransport` function also accepts an optional second argument, allowing you
to pass options like [interceptors](./interceptors.mdx).

### Examples

A recommended way to structure components that need to issue Connect calls is to pass a
`Transport` object to the component. This adds flexibility to components for unit testing, but will vary
depending on the framework being used. Below are links to some helpful examples for passing transports to components
and mocking them in unit tests.

#### React

With React, you have actions such as component props or [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
to provide a transport to your component.

For a working example using the Context API, see the
[Create React App project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/react/cra) in the
[examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

#### Svelte

The suggested method for providing transports to Svelte components makes use of Svelte's
[Context API](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api).

To view a working example of using the Context API to mock transports in Svelte components, check out the
[Svelte project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/svelte) in the
[examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

#### Vue

Structuring a Vue application to allow for easy component testing involves Vue's [Provide/Inject API](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html).

For a working example of mocking transports in Vue components, see the
[Vue project](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es/tree/main/vue) in the
[examples-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es) repo.

### Jest and the jsdom environment

If you are using [jest-environment-jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-jsdom),
you will very likely see an error when you run tests with the router transport,
the protobuf binary format, or any other code relying on the otherwise widely
available [encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API):

```
ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined
```

If you see this error, consider to use [@bufbuild/jest-environment-jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/jest-environment-jsdom)
instead.

### What about mocking `fetch` itself?

Mocking `fetch` itself is a common approach to testing network requests, but it has some drawbacks. Instead, using a schema-based serialization chain with an in-memory transport can be a better approach. Here are some reasons why:

- With schema-based serialization, the request goes through the same process as it would in your actual code, allowing you to test the full flow of your application.
- You can create stateful mocks with an in-memory transport, which can test more complex workflows and scenarios.
- An in-memory transport is fast, so you can quickly set up your tests without worrying about resetting mocks.
- With an in-memory transport, you can eliminate the need for [spy functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) because you can implement any checks directly in your server implementation. This can simplify your testing code and make it easier to understand.
- You can leverage `expect` directly within the code of your mock implementation to verify particular scenarios pertaining to the requests or responses.


## End-to-end testing

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a powerful tool for testing complex web
applications. It can intercept requests and return mocked responses to the web
application under test. If you want to use Playwright with a Connect client, consider using
[@connectrpc/connect-playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect-playwright)
to bring the type-safety of your schema to Playwright's [API Mocks](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock).

A basic example:

```ts
test.describe("mocking Eliza", () => {
  let mock: MockRouter;
  test.beforeEach(({ context }) => {
    mock = createMockRouter(context, {
      baseUrl: "https://demo.connectrpc.com",
    });
  });
  test("mock RPCs at service level", async ({ page }) => {
    await mock.service(ElizaService, {
      say: () => new SayResponse({ sentence: "I feel happy." }),
    });
    // Any calls to Eliza.Say in test code below will be intercepted and invoke
    // the implementation above.
  });
});
```

To get started, take a look at the [connect-playwright repository](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-playwright-es),
and the [example project](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-playwright-es/tree/main/packages/connect-playwright-example).
