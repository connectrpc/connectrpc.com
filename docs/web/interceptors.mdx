An interceptor can add logic to clients, similar to the decorators
or middleware you may have seen in other libraries. Interceptors may
mutate the request and response, catch errors and retry/recover, emit
logs, or do nearly anything else.

For a simple example, this interceptor logs all requests:

```ts
import { Interceptor } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { createConnectTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";

const logger: Interceptor = (next) => async (req) => {
  console.log(`sending message to ${req.url}`);
  return await next(req);
};

createConnectTransport({
  baseUrl: "https://demo.connectrpc.com",
  interceptors: [logger],
});
```

You can think of interceptors like a layered onion. A request initiated
by a client goes through the outermost layer first. Each call to `next()`
traverses to the next layer. In the center, the actual HTTP request is
run by the transport. The response then comes back through all layers and
is returned to the client. In the array of interceptors passed to the
transport, the interceptor at the end of the array is applied first.

To intercept responses, we simply look at the return value of `next()`:

```ts
const logger: Interceptor = (next) => async (req) => {
  console.log(`sending message to ${req.url}`);
  const res = await next(req);
  if (!res.stream) {
    console.log("message:", res.message);
  }
  return res;
};
```

The `stream` property of the response tells us whether this is a streaming
response. A streaming response has not fully arrived yet when we intercept it
â€” we have to wrap it to see individual messages:

```ts
const logger: Interceptor = (next) => async (req) => {
  const res = await next(req);
  if (res.stream) {
    // to intercept streaming response messages, we wrap
    // the AsynchronousIterable with a generator function
    return {
      ...res,
      message: logEach(res.message)
    }
  }
  return res;
};

async function* logEach(stream: AsyncIterable<any>) {
  for await (const m of stream) {
    console.log("message received", m);
    yield m;
  }
}
```
