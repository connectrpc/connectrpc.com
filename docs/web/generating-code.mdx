We mentioned earlier that the ELIZA service defines a Protocol Buffer schema.
So what _is_ that schema? It is really just a simple file that describes the
service, its methods, and their argument and return types:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
}

message SayRequest {
  string sentence = 1;
}

message SayResponse {
  string sentence = 1;
}
```

You can see the full version including comments and some additional RPCs
[on the Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/connectrpc/eliza/file/main:connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza.proto) (BSR).
The `rpc` keyword stands for Remote Procedure Call — a method you can invoke
remotely. The schema is the contract between server and client, and it
precisely defines how data is exchanged down to the very details of
serialization.

The schema comes to life by generating code. For the server, an interface
is generated, and the developer can focus on filling the methods with business
logic. For the client, there really isn't anything to do — the developer can
just call the client methods, rely on the generated types for compile-time
type-safety and serialization, and focus on the application logic.


## Generated SDKs

In the tutorial, we have been using [generated SDKs](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/npm)
with an `npm install` command. When the package was requested on the BSR NPM registry, it ran
the schema through a code generator, and served the generated files as a
package with all required dependencies.

If you want to use a Connect or gRPC service whose schema is published on the
BSR, you can simply use `npm` to install the package, and hit the service with
a Connect client.

See our [documentation on generated SDKs](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/overview)
for details.

## Local generation

We're going to generate our code using [Buf](https://buf.build/product/cli/),
a modern replacement for Google's protobuf compiler, and a compiler plugin for ECMAScript:

- [@bufbuild/buf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/buf) — compiles Protobuf files and generates code for many different languages
- [@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es) — generates TypeScript or JavaScript code from the Protobuf schema

The code we will generate has three runtime dependencies:

- [@connectrpc/connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect) — provides clients, interceptors, errors, and other primitives for Connect
- [@connectrpc/connect-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect-web) — provides the Connect and gRPC-web protocols for web browsers
- [@bufbuild/protobuf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf) — provides Protobuf serialization and more

First, let's install `buf`, the plugins and runtime dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @bufbuild/buf @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es
$ npm install @connectrpc/connect @connectrpc/connect-web @bufbuild/protobuf
```

Next, tell Buf to use the two plugins with a new configuration file:

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml"
# buf.gen.yaml defines a local generation template.
# For details, see https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-gen-yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  # This will invoke protoc-gen-es and write output to src/gen
  - local: protoc-gen-es
    out: src/gen
    # Also generate any imported dependencies
    include_imports: true
    # Add more plugin options here
    opt: target=ts
```

If desired, you can also skip local plugin installation and use [remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/overview).
See the [connect-es example](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage/#45-connect-es) for a buf.gen.yaml which uses remote plugins.

Finally, tell Buf to generate code for the ELIZA schema:

```bash
$ npx buf generate buf.build/connectrpc/eliza
```

If you prefer, you can use `protoc` instead of Buf — the plugins behave like
any other plugin.


### Output

Let's take a peek at what was generated. There is a new file `src/gen/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb.ts` containing the service:

```ts
export const ElizaService: GenService<{
  say: {
    methodKind: "unary";
    input: typeof SayRequestSchema;
    output: typeof SayResponseSchema;
  },
}> = serviceDesc(file_connectrpc_eliza_v1_eliza, 0);
```

The full file includes comments, additional RPCs, and exports for several messages, but the `const`
above really is all Connect needs to provide [clients](/docs/web/using-clients).

To learn more about what `protoc-gen-es` generates, head over to the documentation for the
[Protobuf-ES project](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.1/MANUAL.md#generated-code).

### Using the local files

To use the locally generated files in the tutorial, update the import path:

```diff
- import { ElizaService } from "@buf/connectrpc_eliza.bufbuild_es/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";
+ import { ElizaService } from "./gen/connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza_pb";
```
