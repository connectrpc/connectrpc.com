To integrate with other systems, you may need to send or read HTTP headers
with your RPCs. A common example would be to set a token for authentication
in a request header. Connect also supports trailers, which serve a similar
purpose but can be written _after_ the response body.


## Headers

Headers in Connect are just HTTP headers, and they are represented with the
`Headers` interface of the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)
in Connect. To send a request header, you create a new Headers object, and
pass it in the second argument of the client method, the call options:

```ts
const headers = new Headers();
headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer AbCdEf123456");

await client.say(
  {sentence: "Hello"},
  {headers: headers}
);
```

Note that you do not need to create a `Headers` object. The `headers` property
accepts all inputs that the constructor `new Headers()` accepts. For example,
you can also provide simple object literal with string values:

```ts
await client.say(
  {sentence: "Hello"},
  {headers: {"Authorization": "Bearer AbCdEf123456"}}
);
```

To receive response headers, you can provide a callback:

```ts
await client.say(
  {sentence: "Hello"},
  {onHeader: (headers) => console.log(headers)}
);
```


## Binary headers

To send non-ASCII values in headers, the gRPC-web and Connect protocols
require base64 encoding. Suffix your key with "-Bin" and use the function
`encodeBinaryHeader()`:

```ts
import { encodeBinaryHeader } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";

const data = new Uint8Array([0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef]);
const headers = new Headers();
headers.set(
  "Data-Bin",
  encodeBinaryHeader(data),
);
```

For convenience, the function also accepts a protobuf message or UTF-8 text:

```ts
import { MyMessage } from "./my_message_pb.js";

headers.set(
  "My-Message-Bin",
  encodeBinaryHeader(new MyMessage()),
);
headers.set(
  "Greet-Emoji-Bin",
  encodeBinaryHeader("ðŸ‘‹"),
);
```

To decode response headers, use the function `decodeBinaryHeader()`:

```ts
import { decodeBinaryHeader } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";

const value = headers.get("My-Message-Bin");
if (value != null) {
  const message: MyMessage = decodeBinaryHeader(value, MyMessage);
}
```


## Trailers

Trailers are sometimes useful in streaming RPCs, which need to send some
metadata to the client after sending a few messages. To receive response
trailers, you can provide a callback:

```ts
await client.say(
  {sentence: "Hello"},
  {onTrailer: (trailers) => console.log(trailers)}
);
```

This works for the Connect protocol as well as the gRPC-web protocol, for
both unary and server-streaming RPCs, even though they encode trailers
differently. The trailers are represented with the same collection type as
headers, by the `Headers` interface of the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).
