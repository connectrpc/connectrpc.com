## Patterns for error handling

The `async` and `await` keywords make asynchronous code in ECMAScript as
readable as procedural code. In TypeScript however, Promise rejections and
errors caught in try-catch blocks lack type information. This is why we
needed to use additional if-statements in the examples to verify `err` is a
`ConnectError` before we use it as one.

A sensible pattern to avoid this boilerplate is to use centralized error handling,
for example [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)
in React. This will allow you to omit try-catch blocks in most call sites, and
you will only need a try-catch where you want to add behaviour to a specific
error code. Let's write a short [assertion function](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions)
that helps us to implement this pattern:

```ts
// assert-connect-error.ts
import { ConnectError, Code } from "@bufbuild/connect";

/**
 * Asserts that the given reason is a ConnectError.
 * If the reason is not a ConnectError, or does not
 * have the wanted Code, rethrow it.
 */
export function assertConnectError(
  reason: unknown,
  ...codes: Code[]
): asserts reason is ConnectError {
  if (reason instanceof ConnectError) {
    if (codes.length == 0) {
      return;
    }
    if (codes.includes(reason.code)) {
      return;
    }
  }
  // reason is not a ConnectError, or does
  // not have the wanted Code - rethrow it.
  throw reason;
}
```

Assuming we already have centralized error handling in place, we can now
easily add behavior for a specific error code:

```ts
import { Code } from "@bufbuild/connect-web";
import { assertConnectError } from "./assert-connect-error.js";

try {
  await client.say({sentence: ""});
} catch (reason) {
  const error = assertConnectError(reason, Code.InvalidArgument);
  console.error("Oh no:", error.rawMessage);
}
```

There is no silver bullet for error handling. In general, the most simple and
most direct approach that suits your needs is the best one. We hope we were
able to give you some insight into what is possible if you feel your
application has outgrown the most simple approach.
