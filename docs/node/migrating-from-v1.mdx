Connect-ES v2 is available. Key takeaways:

- We're upgrading to Protobuf-ES version 2. It's the largest change in this release.
- Connect-ES no longer needs its own code generator plugin.
- We're adding support for Next.js 15, Fastify 5, and Express 5.
- We're dropping support for old versions of Node.js and TypeScript. You'll need at least Node.js 18 and TypeScript 4.9.6.

If you're on v1, take a look at the [migration guide](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/blob/main/MIGRATING.md).
