Connect handles HTTP routes and most plumbing for you, but implementing the
actual business logic is still up to you.

You always register your implementation on the `ConnectRouter`. We recommend to
create a file `connect.ts` with a registration function in your project:

```ts
import { ConnectRouter } from "@connectrpc/connect";

export default (router: ConnectRouter) => {}
```

## Register a service


Let's say you have defined a simple service in Protobuf:

```protobuf
message SayRequest {
  string sentence = 1;
}
message SayResponse {
  string sentence = 1;
}
service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
}
```

To register this service, call `router.service()`:

```ts
import { ConnectRouter, HandlerContext } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_connect";
import { SayRequest, SayResponse } from "./gen/eliza_pb";

export default (router: ConnectRouter) =>
  router.service(ElizaService, {
    async say(req: SayRequest, context: HandlerContext) {
      return new SayResponse({
        sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}`,
      });
    }
  });
```

Your method `say()` receives the request message and a context object, and
returns a response message. It is a plain function!


## Plain functions

Your function can return a response message, or a promise for a response
message, or just an initializer for a response message:

```ts
function say(req: SayRequest) {
  return new SayResponse({ sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}` });
}
```

```ts
async function say(req: SayRequest) {
  return { sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}` };
}
```

```ts
const say = (req: SayRequest) => ({ sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}` });
```

You can register any of these functions for the ElizaService.


## Context

The context argument gives you access to headers and service metadata:

```ts
import { HandlerContext } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { SayRequest } from "./gen/eliza_pb";

function say(req: SayRequest, context: HandlerContext) {
  ctx.service.typeName; // the protobuf type name "ElizaService"
  ctx.method.name; // the protobuf rpc name "Say"
  context.requestHeader.get("Foo");
  context.responseHeader.set("Foo", "Bar");
  return new SayResponse({ sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}` });
}
```

## Errors

Instead of returning a response, your method can also raise an error:

```ts
import { Code, ConnectError } from "@connectrpc/connect";

function say() {
  throw new ConnectError("I have no words anymore.", Code.ResourceExhausted);
}
```

`Code` is one of Connects [error codes](/docs/protocol#error-codes). Besides
the code and a message, errors can also contain metadata (a Headers object)
and error details.


## Error details

Error details are a powerful feature. Any protobuf message can be transmitted as
an error detail. Let's use [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`](https://buf.build/googleapis/googleapis/file/main:google/rpc/error_details.proto#L241)
to localize our error message:

```bash
$ buf generate buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
```

```ts
import { Code, ConnectError } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_connect";
import { LocalizedMessage } from "./gen/google/rpc/error_details_pb";

function say() {
  const details = [
    new LocalizedMessage({
      locale: "fr-CH",
      message: "Je n'ai plus de mots.",
    }),
    new LocalizedMessage({
      locale: "ja-JP",
      message: "もう言葉がありません。",
    }),
  ];
  const metadata = new Headers({
    "words-left": "none"
  });
  throw new ConnectError(
    "I have no words anymore.",
    Code.ResourceExhausted,
    metadata,
    details
  );
}
```


## Streaming

Before showing the various handlers for streaming endpoints, we'd like to
reference the [Streaming](../go/streaming.md) page from Connect-Go as a caveat.
Because while Connect for Node.js does support all three variations of
streaming endpoints, there are tradeoffs that should be considered before
diving in.

Streaming can be a very powerful approach to APIs in the right circumstances,
but it also requires great care. Remember, with great power comes great
responsibility.

In **_client streaming_**, the client sends multiple messages. Once the server
receives all the messages, it responds with a single message. In Protobuf
schemas, client streaming methods look like this:

```protobuf
service ElizaService {
  rpc Vent(stream VentRequest) returns (VentResponse) {}
}
```

In TypeScript, client streaming methods receive an asynchronous iterable of
request messages (you can iterate over them with a for [await...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loop):

```typescript
async function vent(reqs: AsyncIterable<VentRequest>): Promise<VentResponse> {}
```

In **_server streaming_**, the client sends a single message, and the server responds
with multiple messages. In Protobuf schemas, server streaming methods look like
this:

```protobuf
service ElizaService {
  rpc Introduce(IntroduceRequest) returns (stream IntroduceResponse) {}
}
```

In TypeScript, server streaming methods receive a request message, and return an
asynchronous iterable of response messages, typically with a
[generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*).

```ts
async function *introduce(req: IntroduceRequest) {
  yield { sentence: `Hi ${req.name}, I'm eliza` };
  yield { sentence: `How are you feeling today?` };
}
```

In **_bidirectional streaming_** (often called bidi), the client and server may both
send multiple messages. Often, the exchange is structured like a conversation:
the client sends a message, the server responds, the client sends another
message, and so on. Keep in mind that this always requires end-to-end HTTP/2
support (regardless of RPC protocol)!


## Helper Types

Service implementations are type-safe. The `service()` method of the
`ConnectRouter` accepts a `ServiceImpl<T>`, where `T` is a service type.
A `ServiceImpl` has a method for each RPC, typed as `MethodImp<M>`, where `M` is
a method info object.

You can use these types to compose your service without registering it right
away:

```typescript
import type { MethodImpl, ServiceImpl } from "@connectrpc/connect";

export const say: MethodImpl<typeof ElizaService.methods.say> = ...

export const eliza: ServiceImpl<typeof ElizaService> = {
  // ...
};

export class Eliza implements ServiceImpl<typeof ElizaService> {
  async say(req: SayRequest) {
    return {
      sentence: `You said ${req.sentence}`,
    };
  }
}
```

Registering the examples above:

```typescript
import { ConnectRouter } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_connect";
import { say, eliza, Eliza } from "./other-file";

export default (router: ConnectRouter) => {
  // using const say
  router.service(ElizaService, { say });

  // alternative for using const say
  router.rpc(
    ElizaService,
    ElizaService.methods.say,
    say
  );

  // using const eliza
  router.service(ElizaService, eliza);

  // using class Eliza
  router.service(ElizaService, new Eliza());
}
```
