# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with Connect and gRPC-Web

[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a mechanism
that allows servers to restrict requests from JavaScript running in a web
browser. For example, consider a malicious web page making requests to an API
on a different domain. Simply visiting this page could run arbitrary actions on
your behalf.

To avoid this problem, browsers ask the target for permission to issue a request,
if the request originates from somewhere else than the target. They send a
preflight request, and the server replies with CORS information. The browser
decides whether to issue or deny the actual request, and will only expose
response headers to JavaScript that are explicitly allowed.

Both Connect and gRPC-Web require CORS preflights for cross-origin requests.
This document serves as a reference in case you want to learn more about the
requirements, or need to configure CORS in a network component.

If your server is written with `connect-go`, the [`connectrpc.com/cors`](https://github.com/connectrpc/cors-go)
package makes it trivial to support CORS correctly. You can find an example [here](/docs/go/deployment#cors).
A similar feature is available for connect-es with the [`cors` export](/docs/node/server-plugins/#cors).

## Configurations by protocol

### gRPC-web

```
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Grpc-Timeout,X-Grpc-Web,X-User-Agent
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Grpc-Status, Grpc-Message, Grpc-Status-Details-Bin
```

### Connect

```
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Connect-Protocol-Version, Connect-Timeout-Ms, X-User-Agent
```

## Preflight request

Here's an example for a CORS preflight request with the Connect protocol:

```
OPTIONS /connectrpc.greet.v1.GreetService/Greet HTTP/1.1
Origin: https://connectrpc.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Connect-Protocol-Version,Content-Type
[other headers elided...]
```

Note that the browser transmits the origin, as well as the HTTP methods and
header names of the actual request.

## Preflight response

Here is an example for a CORS preflight response for the preflight above that
allows all requests with the Connect and gRPC-Web protocols, and asks the browser
to cache the information:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://connectrpc.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST,GET
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Connect-Protocol-Version,Connect-Timeout-Ms,Grpc-Timeout,X-Grpc-Web,X-User-Agent
Access-Control-Max-Age: 7200
Vary: Origin,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers
[other headers elided...]
```

Let's take a look at the details:

### Allowing origins

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://connectrpc.com` allows browsers to make
requests from connectrpc.com via https with the default port 443.

### Allowing methods and headers

`Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST,GET` is required to support gRPC-Web and
Connect. gRPC-Web will only use POST. Connect uses POST and optionally GET.

`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Connect-Protocol-Version,Connect-Timeout-Ms,Grpc-Timeout,X-Grpc-Web,X-User-Agent`
allows all necessary request headers for Connect and gRPC-Web.

> **Note:** If your application uses custom request headers, you must explicitly
> allow them. This includes commonly used headers such as `Authorization`.

### Caching preflight responses

`Access-Control-Max-Age: 7200` lets browsers cache CORS information for longer,
which reduces the number of preflight requests. The value is given in seconds.
Any changes to your CORS setup won't take effect until the cached data expires.
Firefox caps this value at 24h, and modern Chrome caps it at 2h (7200 seconds).

`Vary: Origin,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers` is
used by the browser to cache CORS information based on the given header names.
If the CORS preflight response is dynamic, all request headers resulting in
conditional preflight responses must be added to the `Vary` response header to
avoid poisoning intermediate caches.

## Actual response

Here is what an actual response will look like, after a successful preflight
request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Grpc-Status,Grpc-Message,Grpc-Status-Details-Bin
[other headers elided...]

{"greeting": "Hello, Buf!"}
```

All three exposed headers are necessary to support gRPC-Web. Content-Type does
not need to be exposed explicitly, because it is a [CORS-safelisted response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_response_header).

> **Note:** If your application uses custom response headers, you must explicitly
> expose them.  
> If your application uses custom response **trailers**, you must expose them with
> a `Trailer-` prefix, because Connect sends trailers for unary RPCs as headers.
> If your service sets the trailer `Bar`, the response must expose `Trailer-Bar`.

## Connect GET

For side-effect-free RPCs such as simple queries, Connect supports GET requests
that do not require CORS preflights. Browsers will immediately issue the actual
request, but there are two requirements:

1. No request headers must be set, including `Connect-Timeout-Ms` or `Grpc-Timeout`,
   or any application-specific header.
2. The response must allow the origin, for example with the response header
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://connectrpc.com`.

If the first requirement is not met, a preflight request is issued. If the second
requirement is not met, the request will error in the browser.

## Avoid wildcards

While many CORS headers allow a wildcard `*`, they only do for requests without
credentials, such as cookies, TLS client certificates, or authorization headers.

It's best to avoid wildcards in production. CORS
libraries typically provide mechanism for common use cases like allowing
multiple origins.

## Private network access

[Private network access](https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/) is an
addition to CORS that restricts the ability of websites to send requests to
servers on private networks. Chrome has been the first to implement the feature.
More information can be found in the [accompanying blog post](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update/).

If your application uses private network access, you will have to set the
preflight response header `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network` accordingly,
and add `Vary: Access-Control-Request-Private-Network` in case you cache CORS
information.
