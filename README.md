Connect
=======

Connect is a family of libraries for building browser- and gRPC-compatible
APIs with Protocol Buffers. If you're tired of hand-written boilerplate and
turned off by massive frameworks, Connect is for you.

This repository houses the [connectrpc.com website][website], which includes
Connect's [governance] and [security] policies. It's also the home of Connect's
[RFC process][rfc].

For more on Connect, see the [announcement blog post][blog], the
[website], an [example server][examples-go], or the [protocol
specification][protocol].
