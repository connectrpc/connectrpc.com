        Connect shines in production. Implementations are focused &mdash; a few
        thousand lines of code, a handful of essential options, and a
        cURL-friendly protocol &mdash; which makes them stable, predictable, and
        debuggable.

    title: "Compatible with gRPC",
    description: (
      <>
        In addition to its own protocol, Connect servers and backend clients
        also support gRPC &mdash; including streaming! They interoperate
        seamlessly with Envoy, grpcurl, gRPC Gateway, and every other gRPC
        implementation. Connect servers handle gRPC-Web requests natively,
        without a translating proxy.

      <>
        Connect builds on primitives you already know. Go handlers slot right
        into your <code>net/http</code> server and work with your existing
        middleware, router, and observability. TypeScript clients stay close to
        the <code>fetch</code> API and integrate cleanly with popular UI
        frameworks.

        , the industry&apos;s most battle-tested schema definition language, and
        skip the hand-written boilerplate. Connect handles server-side routing,
        serialization, and compression, and it generates idiomatic clients in
        Go, TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin.
